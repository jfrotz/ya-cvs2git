Yet another CVS to Git

My team has almost finished migrating a 20 year old CVS archive to git.
This script is the denuded script which we used to migrate to our GitLab instance.

This includes all of the how-to fixups that we needed to execute in order to get the migration to complete successfully.
You will definitely find expedient workarounds to solving the engineering problem in this solution.

See the fault examples pages for types of faults which require hand-editing your CVS ,v files.

It is hoped that anyone who is on the trailing edge of migration, finds this information useful.
